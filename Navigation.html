<h1>NAVIGATION</h1>
<h2>Desktop Navigation</h2>
<p align="justify">The desktop navigation is straightforward. The user can easily navigate the website. It has a constant navigation menu on every screen which makes it easy to go back to the homepage. The only thing that is changing is the appearance of the current section. It displays consistent headers and footers on all pages. Horizontal navigation bar is used. A header on top of the current page tells what the visitor is currently viewing. 

The website does not have bread crumb trail which is fine since it does not have sub-menus. It is a quick-loading site. It has link to homepage, email address, and have navigation button to the rest of the site. It contains the necessary elements for a remittance website.

A customer or visitor can send feedback through the “Email Us” menu.

I’ve also noticed that there is no sitemap available for this site.

<h2>Mobile Navigation</h2>
<p align="justify">The website is not displayed exactly the same as seen on a desktop. The date & time element is missing and texts are group to one side rather than nicely spread out.
