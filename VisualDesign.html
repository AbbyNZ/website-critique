<h1>VISUAL DESIGN</h1>
<br>
<h2>THEME</h2>
<p align="justify">The website used five font colours, namely: blue, red, white, yellow, and black. The blue, red, white, and yellow colours represent the four colours of the Philippine flag. Information and images used in this website all relates to remittance/money transfer.

No background image is used in the website. The logo used the design of the Philippine flag. The images used in the banner shows the famous Rizal Park and the iconic Sky City Tower.

<h2>PAGE LAYOUT</h2>
<p align="justify">All pages in the website used the same font, style, and appearance. The font type used is Segoe UI. The website used consistent colours. It employs adaptive design. The print version includes navigation and page URL in the footer. 

I have used the six principles of design to determine how effective and how good the design of the website is.
</p>

<h3>Balance</h3>
<p align="justify">The website shows even distribution of non-identically sized components to create layouts without perfect symmetry. This type of balance is called Asymmetrical. Its purpose is to create tension or movement. Asymmetrical layouts tend to appear informal and dynamic.
</p>

<h3>Proximity</h3>
<p align="justify">Proximity spacing is not good. Same elements are grouped together with the use of rules and different font colours to visually separate unlike items.

Even though related items are put together, it appears the items are too close to each other. The home page looked too cramped. It did not use the principle of white space. It requires adequate spacing.
</p>

<h3>Alignment</h3>
<p align="justify">Most of the elements are left-aligned, some captions or headings are center-aligned, and paragraphs are justified.

Alignment of the website varies depending on the contents of the page. Using the right type of alignment made the layout easier to read. Graphics/images are well-aligned. In general, the website has a good alignment.
</p>

<h3>Repetition and Consistency</h3>
<p align="justify">The website used style sheets to maintain consistency throughout all pages. Using styles can save time when making format changes and ensure consistency throughout the website.  The website adhered to using only one type of font and using only 5 colours throughout the page layout and repeats it on each page. Same paragraph spacing is applied to all pages. Grid is used to maintain consistent placement of elements. Footer on each page follows the principle of repetitions and consistency. Repetition of a theme reinforces the message.
</p>

<h3>Contrast</h3>
<p align="justify">The background colour gives a good contrast against the 5 different colours of the text. Important notes have bigger font size and typed bold to set apart from the rest of the text. Images with thin lines surrounding it are also used to create contrast. The use of different font size, colours, and styles can create contrast and get the readerâ€™s attention. However, too much use of highlighting and emphasis of words can create the opposite effect. Instead of standing out, it will just distract or annoy the reader. The home page looks restricted that the contrast created was not maximised.
</p>

<h3>White Space</h3>
<p align="justify">The website does not use the principle of white space accordingly. No enough space between and around the text and images used. Thus, making the website looked crowded. Text and graphics are crammed in the home page. It seems too much information was put into one page. It needs visual breathing room for the eye. The full width of the page was not utilized well. The font size appears to be a bit small. It is hard to read for people using reading glasses.
