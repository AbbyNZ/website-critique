<h1>IMPROVEMENTS AND HIGHLIGHTS</h1>
<h2>Visual Design</h2>
<p align="justify">Even distribution of non-identically sized components or elements made the page layout well-balanced. However, maximising the use of white space, made the website look crowded.</p> 

<p align="justify">Too much use of highlighting and emphasis of captions and other texts have created the opposite effect. Instead of standing out, it gave an overcrowded look.</p>

<h2>White Balance</h2>
<p align="justify">The site appears to be confined because there is no enough white space between the elements. It needs a breathing room.</p>

<h2>Page Layout</h2>
<p align="justify">The whole page layout was not use wisely. There is a lot unused space. Increasing the size of the layout will give more room to spread the contents of the page. Thus, avoiding the overcrowded look.</p>

<h2>Sitemap</h2>
<p align="justify">The website has no sitemap. Having a sitemap is useful especially if there is incompatibility issues with the type of browser used. It will be an added feature to the website.</p>

<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p align="justify">Most of the errors are due to images having no alternative text and no existing form label. As the first principle of web accessibility, alternative text should be added to images. It provides textual alternative to non-text content in web pages. It makes the content and function of the image to be accessible to those who have visual or cognitive disabilities.</p>

<h2>Ad Banners</h2>
<p align="justify">No ad banners used in this website. Ad banners can increase the site popularity. However, some ad banners come with malwares. Since this is an online remittance website, it is a software threat that the website can do without.</p>

<h2>Images</h2>
<p align="justify">Some of the images used become pixelated when zooming the webpage. Itâ€™s better to use high quality images to avoid becoming pixelated when zoomed.</p>

<h2>Mobile Navigation</h2>
<p align="justify">According to Google developers website, there are items that are needed to be fixed such as, use legible font sizes, size tap targets appropriately, configure the viewport, eliminate render-blocking JavaScript and CSS in the above-the-fold content, leverage browser, caching, optimize the images, minify JavaScript, and minify HTML.</p>
