<h1>USABILITY & ACCESSIBILITY</h1>
<h2>Usability</h2>
<p align="justify">Breadcrumb trail is not necessary to this website since it is easy to navigate. Images have no alternative tags/text. No site map provided where users can use it if there are incompatibility issues.</p> 

<p align="justify">It appears the website match the needed requirements of the customers/client. In my opinion, it is usable and functional to the user.</p>

<p align="justify">One of the most important aspects of usability is “page speed”. People will leave a website if a page takes more than 3 or 4 seconds to load.</p>

<p align="justify">I have checked the performance of the website using the GTmetrix, where it shows the page speed grade, total page size, and page load time of the site. 
</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="smallGTmetrix.png" alt="GTmetrix">
<h4><a href="http://gtmetrix.com" target="_blank">(Source:gtmetrix.com)</a>
</h4>
</div>

<p>As shown in the figure above, the page load time is 3.65 seconds. It is  below 4 seconds, which means the page load time is still acceptable. However, the speed can be improved.</p>
<p align="justify">One way to improve usability is to survey users. Ask site visitors about their experience and provide support when they experience errors.
</p>

<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p align="justify">I’ve used the WebAim Wave and EvalAccess 2.0 test tool to check the accessibility of PinoyRemit. The results are shown below:
</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="Smallwave.png" alt="webaim">
<h4>
<a href="http://wave.webaim.org" target="new">(Source: wave.webaim.org)</a>
</h4>
<img src="EvalAccess.png" alt="EvalAccess">
<h4>
<a href="http://sipt07.si.ehu.es/evalaccess2" target="new">(Source:sipt07.si.ehu.es/evalaccess2/servlet/Evaluate)</a>
</h4>
</div>

<p align="justify">The results show that the website has many errors with regards to missing alternative text, label, and document language. Some of these errors require immediate correction to improve access to web documents.
</p>

<h2>SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION</h2>
<p align="justify">Performed a SEO analysis test using The Reaction Engine website with the keyword “remittance” and the result is shown below: 
</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="reactionengine.png" alt="reactionengine">
<br>
<br>
<img src="seoAnalysis.png" alt="SEO">
<h4><a href="http://www.reactionengine.com" target="new">(Source: www.reactionengine.com)</a>
</h4>
</div>

<p align="justify">Since PinoyRemit website is still quite new, the test returned with a zero result. The website can be optimised by using meta description/keywords, add links that is related, and advertise on search engines. 
</p>
<p>Make the website accessible to increase usability. It should have consistent interface across the entire website, e.g. consistent navigation across all pages. No unannounced pop-ups. Large chunks of information need to be divided to increase usability. Use CSS for layout. No screen flickering that will distract users and minimal flash movement. 
</p>
<p align="justify">Based on the Browsershots.org result, it appears the website can be opened using other browsers with no major incompatibility issues. However, one element that uses flash cannot be displayed in most browsers.</p>
</p>
<div align="center">

<h4><a href="http://browsershots.org" target="new">(Source: browsershots.org)</a>
</h4>
</div>

<h2>SITE POPULARITY</h2>
<p align="justify">The site does not appear in the Ranking.com database. This is probably because it is still a new website and only caters to Filipinos who are sending money to the Philippines. There are a lot of Filipinos out there who are not aware of its existence. To make these people or potential customers use this website, PinoyRemit has to make a strong online presence by advertising via social media and Filipino newspapers.
</p>

<p align="justify">After running the NetCraft test tool, it returned with no results regarding PinoyRemit website’s rank.
</p>

<p align="justify">I also checked Alexa.com, it does not have enough data to rank the website. No enough data to estimate these metrics, percent of visitors and rank in the country.
